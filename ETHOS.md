# Ethos

Ode is built on a foundation of principles that prioritize the craft of writing and the joy of reading over metrics and engagement. It is built on my own personal ethos for how I approach my writing, and I would hope there are others like me, too.

## Core Principles

**Writing First, Numbers Never**  
No counts, no metrics, no data. Ode believes that good writing speaks for itself, and writers should focus on their craft rather than chasing numbers. This intentional absence begets authentic expression.

**Readers Over Everything**  
Built for human readers. Every design decision favors readability, contemplation, and the intimate connection between writer and reader with intentional, focused reading. The reader is the most important part about writing. This is how it has always been.

**Simplicity as a Choice**  
Ode strips away everything non-essential to create a distraction-free environment for both the writer and the reader.

**Ownership and Control**  
Your words belong to you. Own your writing, control your presentation, and your distribution. No medium can sunset your work, change your terms, or hold your words hostage. True independence requires true ownership.

**Timeless Over Trendy**  
Built to last, not to chase trends. Ode embraces the aesthetics and values of thoughtful publishing: the kind that existed in times that seem long gone. It's designed to endure as long as the writer does.

*This is an ode to the craft, to the reader, and to the writer.*
