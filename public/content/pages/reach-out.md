If these words have found an echo in your heart, or if you wish to share a verse of your own, you are welcome to reach out. No forms, no intermediaries—just a letter sent the old way: [you(at)whereyouare(dot)com](mailto:#).

May your own wanderings be fruitful, and may you always find beauty in the world.

> “The world is too much with us; late and soon,  
> Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers;—  
> Little we see in Nature that is ours...”  
> — William Wordsworth
